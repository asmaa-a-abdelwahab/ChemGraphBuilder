# Relationships Collector and Processor

This module collects and processes relationship data for different types of relationships using the `RelationshipPropertiesExtractor` and `RelationshipDataProcessor` classes.

## Available Relationship Types

- Assay_Compound
- Assay_Gene
- Gene_Protein
- Compound_Gene
- Compound_Similarity
- Compound_Compound_Cooccurrence
- Compound_Gene_Cooccurrence
- Compound_Gene_Interaction
- Compound_Transformation


## Usage Examples

### Python

To use the `RelationshipsCollectorProcessor` class in Python, follow the example below:

```python
from relationship_collector_processor import RelationshipsCollectorProcessor

# Set the relationship type
relationship_type = "Assay_Compound"  # Change to the desired relationship type

# Initialize the collector
collector = RelationshipsCollectorProcessor(relationship_type=relationship_type, start_chunk=0)

# Collect and process the relationship data
collector.collect_relationship_data()
```

### Command Line

To collect and process relationship data from the command line, use the following command:

```sh
# Collect and process the relationship data for the specified relationship type
collect-process-relationships --relationship_type Assay_Compound --start_chunk 0
```

Replace `Assay_Compound` with any of the available relationship types to collect different data.
If your data is downloaded as chunks and you were not able to complete the 
download at once, you can use the `start_chunk` argument to specify the starting 
chunk index and continue the download.
