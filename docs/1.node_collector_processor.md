You can use the `NodesCollectorProcessor` class in both Python and the command line:

#### **Available Nodes**
- `Compound`
- `BioAssay`
- `Gene`
- `Protein`

### Python Script Example

You can use the `NodesCollectorProcessor` class within a Python script as follows:

```python
from chemgraphbuilder.node_collector_processor import NodesCollectorProcessor
from chemgraphbuilder.setup_data_folder import SetupDataFolder


node_type = "Compound"  # Change to "BioAssay", "Gene", or "Protein" as needed
enzyme_list = ['CYP2D6', 'CYP3A4']

# Initialize and setup the data directory before collecting any data
setup_folder = SetupDataFolder()
setup_folder.setup()

# Initialize the collector
collector = NodesCollectorProcessor(node_type=node_type, enzyme_list=enzyme_list, start_chunk=0)

# Collect and process the data
collector.collect_and_process_data()

# Close the connection
collector.close()
```


### Command Line Interface (CLI) Example

You can use the `NodesCollectorProcessor` class from the command line by executing the script with the necessary arguments:

```sh
setup-data-folder
collect-process-nodes --node_type Compound --enzyme_list CYP2D6,CYP3A4 --start_chunk 0 # the default start-chunk is 0
```

The `node_type` argument can be one of `"Compound"`, `"BioAssay"`, `"Gene"`, or `"Protein"`, depending on the type of data you want to collect.
The `enzyme_list` should be a comma-separated string of enzyme names.
The `start_chunk` argument is optional and is used when collecting data for the `Compound` type because the compound data is downloaded as chunks.
If you weren't able to download all the data at once, you can continue the download starting from the desired chunk.
