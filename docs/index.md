# Welcome to ChemGraphBuilder    [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.13237900.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13237900)

The `chemgraphbuilder` package is a specialized tool designed for researchers in bioinformatics, cheminformatics, and computational biology. It enables the construction of detailed knowledge graphs that map the complex interactions between chemical compounds, genes, proteins, and bioassays. These knowledge graphs are critical for visualizing and understanding the multifaceted relationships in biochemical networks.

At its core, `chemgraphbuilder` integrates data from PubChem and utilize Neo4j, creating nodes that represent key entities such as compounds, genes, proteins, and bioassays. It further enriches these graphs by incorporating various relationships, including:

- **BioAssay-Compound Relationships**: Capturing the interactions where bioassays evaluate the effects of specific compounds. This is crucial for understanding the efficacy and mechanism of action of pharmaceuticals.
- **BioAssay-Gene Relationships**: Documenting instances where bioassays study specific genes, providing valuable data on gene function and regulation.
- **Gene-Protein Relationships**: Mapping the connections where genes encode proteins, providing insights into genetic regulation and protein function.
- **Compound-Gene Interactions**: Detailing how compounds interact with genes, categorized into various interaction types such as Inhibitors, Inactivators, Activators, Inducers, Substrates, Ligands, and Inactive compounds. This classification aids in understanding gene regulation, drug mechanisms, and potential therapeutic applications.
- **Compound Similarities**: Highlighting chemical similarities between compounds, which can suggest similar biological activities or shared molecular properties.
- **Compound Co-occurrence**: Identifying instances where compounds or genes co-occur in scientific literature, indicating potential interactions or co-regulation.

## Neo4j Requirements

`chemgraphbuilder` requires a running **Neo4j** database that is accessible via **Bolt URI**, **username**, and **password**.

You can run Neo4j:
- **Locally** (Neo4j Desktop or Docker)
- **Remotely** (Neo4j Aura Cloud)

**Default Bolt port:** `7687`  
**Default Web UI port:** `7474`

## üöÄ Quick Start

Follow these steps to get up and running with `chemgraphbuilder` and Neo4j in under 5 minutes.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install and Run Neo4j

**Option A ‚Äì Docker (fastest)**
```bash
docker run \
  --name neo4j \
  -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \
  -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/testpassword \
  neo4j:5.14
```

* Bolt URI: `bolt://localhost:7687`
* Username: `neo4j`
* Password: `testpassword`
* Web UI: [http://localhost:7474](http://localhost:7474)

**Option B ‚Äì Neo4j Desktop**

1. Download from: [https://neo4j.com/download/](https://neo4j.com/download/)
2. Create a **new project** and database.
3. Note the **Bolt URI**, **username**, and **password**.


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install `chemgraphbuilder`

```bash
pip install chemgraphbuilder
```
Or visit the [PyPI Project Page](https://pypi.org/project/chemgraphbuilder) for the latest release.



### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Connect to Neo4j in Python

```python
from chemgraphbuilder import Neo4jBase

# Connection details
NEO4J_URI = "bolt://localhost:7687"
NEO4J_USER = "neo4j"
NEO4J_PASSWORD = "testpassword"

# Connect and test
db = Neo4jBase(uri=NEO4J_URI, user=NEO4J_USER, password=NEO4J_PASSWORD)
db.test_connection()
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ First Example

```python
# Create a simple test node
db.run_query("CREATE (:Test {name: 'Hello Neo4j'})")
print("Node created!")
```

Check in the Neo4j Browser:

```cypher
MATCH (n) RETURN n;
```
